# Welcome to Storybook

Storybook is now set up for your AST Boilerplate project!

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation. It helps you:
- Build components independently from your app
- Test different component states
- Document components with examples
- Share components with your team

## Getting Started

### Running Storybook

Start the Storybook development server:

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

### Building Storybook

Build a static version of Storybook:

```bash
pnpm run build-storybook
```

## Creating Stories

Since this project uses Astro components, you'll need to:

1. **Render the HTML structure** - Astro components are compiled to HTML, so in Storybook we recreate that HTML structure
2. **Apply styles** - Import component-specific styles in your story files
3. **Initialize JavaScript** - If your component has interactive behavior, you'll need to initialize it

### Example Story Structure

```javascript
export default {
  title: 'Components/MyComponent',
  tags: ['autodocs'],
};

const Template = (args) => {
  return `
    <div class="my-component">
      {/* Component HTML here */}
    </div>
  `;
};

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  // Component props/args here
};
```

## Example Components

Check out the **Accordion** component story to see how an existing component has been set up in Storybook.

## Next Steps

1. Create stories for your other components
2. Test component variations and edge cases
3. Document component APIs with controls
4. Share your component library with the team

Happy building! 🚀
